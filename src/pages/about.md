###### Our vision is to help you who have problems selling your house. Miabuyshouses.com buys houses in Florida

###### **AS-IS at EASE.**

## “You Need To Sell Your House Fast In Florida!”&#xA;

We Buy Houses Anywhere And Other Parts of Florida, And At Any Price. Check Out How Our Process Works. We’re Ready To Give You A Fair Offer For Your House.
If you want to sell your Florida house… we’re ready to give you a fair all-cash offer.

Stop the frustration of your unwanted property. Let us buy your Florida house now, regardless of condition.

Avoiding foreclosure? Facing divorce? Moving? Upside down in your mortgage? Liens? It doesn’t matter whether you live in it, you’re renting it out, it’s vacant, or not even habitable. We help owners who have inherited an unwanted property, own a vacant house, are behind on payments, owe liens, downsized, and can’t sell… even if the house needs repairs that you can’t pay for… and yes, even if the house is fire damaged or has bad rental tenants.

Basically, if you have a property and need to sell it… we’d like to make you a fair cash offer and close on it when you’re ready to sell.

**Even if an agent can’t sell your house, we can help**. (Sometimes selling a house through a real estate agent is not for everyone.)

And as a bonus…

*   you don’t need to clean up and repair the property

*   don’t waste time finding an agent who you trust and who can deliver on their promise of selling your house quickly

*   you won’t need to sign a contract that binds you to an agent for a certain term

*   or deal with the paperwork and the waiting and wondering (and hoping)

**We’ll know very quickly if we can help you**, and unlike selling through an agent, you don’t have to wait to see if the buyer can get financing… **we’re ready to buy right now!**

We work differently at MIABuysHouses.com. When you contact us and submit the short property information form (below), we’ll **give you a fair all-cash offer on your house within 24 hours**… and the best part is: **we can close whenever YOU choose to close** – it’s entirely up to you. It doesn’t matter what condition the house is in, or even if there are tenants in there that you can’t get rid of… don’t worry about it. We’ll take care of it for you. And if you need the cash quickly, we can close in as little as 7 days because we buy houses with cash and don’t have to rely on traditional bank financing. 

All that hassle can add stress, months to the process, and in the end after paying the agent’s expensive fees, you may or may not be ahead of the game.

In short…

No matter what condition your house is in; no matter what situation or timeframe you’re facing… 

**Our goal is to help make your life easier and get you out from under the property that’s** stressing you out… while still paying a fast, fair, and honest price for your house.
