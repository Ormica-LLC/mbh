## Selling To MiaBuysHouses.com vs. Listing With A Local Florida Agent

Even in a seller’s market like Florida, it’s smart to look at your options and see what will actually help you best reach your goals with the sale of your house. While you may be able to get a higher “top line” sales price listing with a local agent, that doesn’t always boil down to more money in your pocket or less headache. **Dive into the details below to compare your options. ** Selling w/ An AgentSOLD To MiaBuysHouses.com**Commissions / Fees:***6%* on average is paid by you, the sellerNONE**Who Pays Closing Costs?:***2%* on average is paid by you, the sellerNONE – We pay all costs**Inspection & Financing Contingency\*:***Yes*, sales can [fall through](http://www.trulia.com/blog/5-reasons-home-sales-fall-prevent/)NONE**Appraisal Needed:***Yes*, the sale is often subject to appraisalNONE – We make *cash offers***Average Days Until Sold:**+/- 91 DaysIMMEDIATE CASH OFFER**Number of Showings:**It Depends1 (Just Us)**Closing Date:**30-60 +/- days after accepting buyers offerThe Date Of YOUR CHOICE**Who Pays For Repairs?:**Negotiated During Inspection PeriodNONE – We pay for all repairs



## Work The Numbers And See Which Way Helps You Get There…

When you really work the numbers you start to see the real benefits that each way of selling your Florida house offers.

Yes, here at MiaBuysHouses.com we won’t be able to offer you full retail value for your house… but we also offer other benefits that the traditional house sale route can’t offer.

Like…

### **From offer to close** and cash in your hand in as little as 7 days

You can get rid of the headache of that property fast and **avoid paying any more utility payments**, **tax** payments, **insurance** payments, **mortgage** payments, you get the drill. If you list your house and wait 90+ days to close… you have to figure in all of the costs of holding that property during the time you have that property listed and are waiting for the property to close.

### **Don’t worry about fixing anything up** or cleaning your house again and again for buyer after buyer

We don’t care how dirty your house is (*we’ve seen worse!)* or how many repairs are needed *(a complete fixer? great! we love projects).*.. [**we’d like to make an offer on your house.**](https://ormicaseller.carrot.com/sell-your-house/) This saves you time and money that you can keep in your pocket.

### **Don’t worry about paying those pesky closing fees** (we’ve got you covered)

Because we are a **full-service professional home buyer here in Florida**, we make it easy for you. We pay for all of the closing costs. What we offer you is what you get (of course minus any mortgage payoff or other encumbrances on the property). Pretty refreshing eh?

So when you add up the time you could save by working with MiaBuysHouses.com, the no-hassle experience, and the money you’ll save on commissions, fees, and holding costs while you wait to sell the traditional route… for many area homeowners selling to a professional house buyer is the best viable option.

Is it for you?
