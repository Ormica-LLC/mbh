      - title: What is your process?
        content: >
          A:  Great question. I am not an agent, and I don’t list houses. I am a
          professional home buyer: I buy houses that meet my purchasing
          criteria. From there I may repair the house and resell it to another
          homeowner or keep it as a rental ourselves.
      - content: >
          A:  Many of the houses I purchase are below market value (we do this
          so we can resell it at a profit to another homeowner). I am looking to
          get a fair discount on a property. However, in my experience, many
          sellers aren’t necessarily expecting a large “windfall” on the
          property but rather appreciate that I can offer cash, I close very
          quickly (no waiting for financing), and no time or effort, or expense
          is required on your part of fix up the property or pays agent fees. If
          that’s what you’re looking for and you see the value in getting your
          house sold fast… let’s see if I can come to a fair win-win price.
          (Besides, my no-obligation pricing commitment means that you do not
          have to move forward with the offer we give… but it’s good to know
          what I am offering!)
        title: 'Q:  Do you pay fair prices for properties?'
      - content: >
          A:  Great question and I am an open book: My process is very
          straightforward. I look at the location of the property, what repairs
          are needed, the current condition of the property, and the values of
          comparable houses sold in the area recently. As you know, house values
          have taken a huge hit in the last 5 years and most areas still haven’t
          seen prices come back up. I take many pieces of information into
          consideration… and come up with a fair price that works for me and
          works for you too.
        title: 'Q:  How do you determine the price to offer on my house?'
      - title: What if my business is technical?
        content: >-
          No product or service is too technical to learn and understand. Part
          of our initial onboarding is an in-depth understanding of your
          offerings, your target audience and your level of technical writing
          needed.
      - title: How fast can we get started?
        content: >-
          The onboarding process typically lasts 3-4 days and consists of an
          intro video call, an interview, a questionnaire and some back and
          forth communication for technical purposes. After that, we can go as
          fast as you need.
      - title: Who handles the design?
        content: >-
          You can choose to provide the design yourself, or I can include a
          design element to your proposal. I work with several wonderful
          designers with ample experience in web, digital, campaign and
          marketing design.
