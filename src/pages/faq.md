      - title: What is your process?
        content: >
          A:  Great question. I am not an agent, and I don’t list houses. I am a
          professional home buyer: I buy houses that meet my purchasing
          criteria. From there I may repair the house and resell it to another
          homeowner or keep it as a rental ourselves.
      - content: >
          A:  Many of the houses I purchase are below market value (we do this
          so we can resell it at a profit to another homeowner). I am looking to
          get a fair discount on a property. However, in my experience, many
          sellers aren’t necessarily expecting a large “windfall” on the
          property but rather appreciate that I can offer cash, I close very
          quickly (no waiting for financing), and no time or effort, or expense
          is required on your part of fix up the property or pays agent fees. If
          that’s what you’re looking for and you see the value in getting your
          house sold fast… let’s see if I can come to a fair win-win price.
          (Besides, my no-obligation pricing commitment means that you do not
          have to move forward with the offer we give… but it’s good to know
          what I am offering!)
        title: 'Q:  Do you pay fair prices for properties?'
      - content: >
          A:  Great question and I am an open book: My process is very
          straightforward. I look at the location of the property, what repairs
          are needed, the current condition of the property, and the values of
          comparable houses sold in the area recently. As you know, house values
          have taken a huge hit in the last 5 years and most areas still haven’t
          seen prices come back up. I take many pieces of information into
          consideration… and come up with a fair price that works for me and
          works for you too.
        title: 'Q:  How do you determine the price to offer on my house?'
      - content: >
          A: This is what makes my service stand out from the traditional method
          of selling your house: There are NO fees or commissions when you sell
          your house to me. I'll make you an offer, and if it’s a fit then I'll
          buy your house (and I'll often pay for the closing costs too!). No
          hassle. No fees. I make my money after I pay for repairs on the house
          (if any) and sell it for a profit (I am taking the risks here on
          whether I can sell it for a profit or not, once I buy the house from
          you… the responsibility is mine and you walk away without the burden
          of the property and its payments… and often with cash in your hand).
        title: 'Q:  Are there any fees or commissions to work with you?'
      - content: >
          A: Real estate agents list properties and hope that someone will buy
          them. The agent shows the properties to prospective buyers if there
          are any (the average time to sell a property in many markets right now
          is 6-12 months) and then take a percentage of the sale price if they
          find a buyer. Oftentimes, the agent’s commission is 3-6% of the sale
          price of your house (so if it’s a $100,000 house, you’ll pay between
          $3,000 – $6,000 in commissions to an agent). Agents provide a great
          service for those that can wait 6-12 months to sell and who don’t mind
          giving up some of that sale price to pay for the commissions. But
          that’s where we’re different: We’re not agents, we’re home buyers. Our
          company actually buys houses. We don’t list houses. Since we’re
          actually the one buying the house from you, and we pay with all cash…
          we can make a decision to buy your house within a couple of days
          (sometimes the same day). Again, we make our living by taking the risk
          to buy the house with our own cash, repair the house, and market it
          ourselves to find a buyer (which is the hard part in this market).

      - title: Who handles the design?
        content: >-
          You can choose to provide the design yourself, or I can include a
          design element to your proposal. I work with several wonderful
          designers with ample experience in web, digital, campaign and
          marketing design.
